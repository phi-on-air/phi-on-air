Hi, I’m @phi-on-air!
Diving into front-end, on the threshold of curiosity and anticipation (of freeCodeCamp and TOP, too) 

My design values are clarity and depth, and I'm excited to make sites that are clear and deep. And fun!

Feel free to have at it with me at falguni.nimje@gmail.com, or if you're a fellow distractable seeking a body double.
